1. What is npm 
   npm is a world's largest software package manager and installer. npm command will do lot of things behind the scenes 
   libraries, packages, and all other production stuff will be taken care by npm command


2. What is parcel/webpack and why do we need it 
   parcel or webpack are types of bundlers in javascript.
   Bundler - A Development tool that combines lot of js files and packages into single code to 
   build a production ready application. We need bundlers in order to reduce the size of the code 
   and improve the performance of application.


3. what is .parcel-cache
   .parcel-cache contains or stores information and dependencies of our project and won't
   re-analyze or re-builds everything from scratch which results very fast in building and
   provides optimization to our code. 


4. What is npx
   npx is a command where we use to execute our code and it takes us to entry point of
   code(src/index.html). We use this command in order to start or build our application.


5. Difference between dependency and dev-dependency 
   devDependencies - these are the packages that we need in our development phase to developing
   and testing purposes only. 

   dependencies - these dependencies are comes into the picture in production phase which takes 
   care of proper running of our application


6. What is Tree Shaking
   While developing an applications some unused code or packages are present in our code or 
   modules. These modules and packages will not be included in our application build process.

   Tree Shaking also known as "Dead Code Elimination".  


7. What is Hot Module Replacement
   HMR in react will helps in updating the modules or code browser at runtime without refreshing a 
   whole page. It Improves Development Experience due to it's auto-updating feature. 


8. What is .gitignore and what should we add and not add into it
   gitignore is a folder which taken care of files which are not required while pushing files or 
   modules into our github.

   Some of the files that we add into github are node_modules, dist folder, parcel-cache 
   because these folders contains thousands of dependencies which will generated automatically
   when we run commands and due to this app performance may get effected. regular modules which
   won't generated automatically even after deleting we won't add those files like index.html, 
   app.js etc


9. package.json and package-lock.json 
   Package.json file contains installed packages, description about project, dev-dependencies
   and etc along with thier versions 

   package-lock.json file contains transitive dependencies and continously tracks exact version of 
   the installing packages in our dev environment.


10.why should i not modify package-lock.json
   The package-lock.json file is an important part of Node JS and npm ecosystem. It is 
   automatically generated and maintained by npm and is used to lock some specific versions of 
   pacakges installed in projects. Modifying it generally not recommended due to several reasons 
   Dependency Version Consistency, Depenedency Integration, Collaboration, Conflict Resolution, 
   Reproducibility


11.What is Node_Modules and is that a good idea to push on to git
   node_modules contain thousands of transitive dependencies and these modules are generated 
   automatically. No, We won't push the node_modules into our github because of several reasons 
   like size, redundancy, security, version conflicts etc. 


12.What is dist folder
   The dist folder in react is a folder that contains the all files that we need to develop and 
   run our application which includes JS Files, CSS files and assets of an app. 


13.What is Browserslists
   Browserslists - Is a type of an array which we mention the Browsers along with it's versions to 
   run our applications in those browsers at any cost. This browsers list will present in 
   package.json file.
