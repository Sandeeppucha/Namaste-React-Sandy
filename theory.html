    defer - The defer attribute tells the browser not to wait for the script. Instead, the browser will continue to process the HTML, build DOM. The script loads “in the background”, and then runs when the DOM is fully built.
            Scripts with "defer" never block the page and always execute when the DOM is ready
    async - The async is also somewhat similar to the defer. By using async attribute in script tag the file execute block of code asynchronously. This will lead to errors and confusion to users and developers. When order of script matters using of defer attribute will be usefull.
